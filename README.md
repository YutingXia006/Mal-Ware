# Readme

The artifacts of the CI/CD Pipeline cant be used to start our Project, only locally built ones work.

To get a working jar, either pull the project and build it with your IDE, 
or use the (preferably latest) release from the releases folder in the Repository. 

The reason for this is unknown.

No 2 Clients with the same name should connect to one Server, it may impact performance(it doesnt work) (to be fixed(?))
